**Test Date**: 2025-10-01
**Test URL**: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2
**Tester**: UI Testing Agent
**Login Credentials**: alice@alpha.com / admin123

## Executive Summary

Tested the Export and Import functionality on the assign-data-points-v2 page to verify bug fixes related to `callAPI is not a function` error.

**Overall Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**

---

## Test Results

### 1. Export Functionality - ❌ FAILED

**Test Steps**:
1. Logged in as alice@alpha.com (Admin user for Test Company Alpha)
2. Navigated to `/admin/assign-data-points-v2`
3. Page loaded successfully with 17 pre-selected data points
4. Clicked the "Export" button in the toolbar

**Expected Results**:
- Export button should trigger API call to `/admin/api/assignments/export`
- API should return 200 OK status
- CSV file should download or export data should be processed
- No JavaScript errors in console

**Actual Results**:
- ❌ Export button triggered API call successfully (no `callAPI is not a function` error)
- ❌ **API returned HTTP 404: NOT FOUND**
- ❌ No CSV file downloaded
- ❌ Error message displayed: "Export failed: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND"

**Console Errors**:
```javascript
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND) @ http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/api/assignments/export

[ERROR] [ServicesModule] API call failed: /admin/api/assignments/export Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND

[ERROR] [ImportExportModule] Error fetching assignments: Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND

[ERROR] [ImportExportModule] Export error: Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND

[LOG] [ServicesModule] ERROR: Export failed: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
```

**Status**: **CRITICAL BUG - API Endpoint Not Accessible**

**Screenshots**:
- `screenshots/assign-data-points-v2-initial-load.png` - Initial page state
- `screenshots/export-api-404-error.png` - Export button clicked with error

---

### 2. Import Functionality - ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS

**Test Steps**:
1. Clicked the "Import" button in the toolbar
2. Observed browser behavior

**Expected Results**:
- Import button should open file chooser dialog or import validation modal
- No JavaScript errors

**Actual Results**:
- ✅ Import button successfully opened native file chooser dialog
- ✅ No `callAPI is not a function` error
- ⚠️  Console shows: "Import functionality temporarily unavailable" warning
- ⚠️  File chooser opened but unclear if file upload would work (not tested to avoid data corruption)

**Console Messages**:
```javascript
[LOG] [CoreUI] Import Assignments clicked
[LOG] [AppEvents] toolbar-import-clicked: undefined
[LOG] [ImportExportModule] Starting import process
[LOG] [CoreUI] WARNING: Import functionality temporarily unavailable
[LOG] [ServicesModule] WARNING: Import functionality temporarily unavailable
```

**Status**: **WARNING - Import shows "temporarily unavailable" but file chooser opens**

**Screenshots**:
- `screenshots/import-button-file-chooser.png` - Import button clicked state

## Root Cause Analysis

### Export API Endpoint Investigation

**Finding**: The export route **EXISTS** in the backend code but is **NOT ACCESSIBLE**

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ Route defined in `/app/routes/admin_assignments_api.py:794`:
   ```python
   @assignment_api_bp.route('/export', methods=['GET'])
   def export_assignments():
   ```

2. ✅ Blueprint registered in `/app/routes/__init__.py:7`:
   ```python
   from .admin_assignments_api import assignment_api_bp
   ```

3. ✅ Blueprint included in blueprints list in `/app/routes/__init__.py:14`:
   ```python
   blueprints = [auth_bp, admin_bp, admin_frameworks_api_bp, assignment_api_bp, ...]
   ```

4. ✅ Blueprint URL prefix set in `/app/routes/admin_assignments_api.py:28`:
   ```python
   assignment_api_bp = Blueprint('assignment_api', __name__, url_prefix='/admin/api/assignments')
   ```

**Expected URL**: `http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/api/assignments/export`

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Missing decorator**: The export route might be missing `@login_required`, `@admin_or_super_admin_required`, or `@tenant_required` decorators causing authentication/authorization failure that manifests as 404
2. **Route conflict**: Another route might be overriding this endpoint
3. **Blueprint registration order**: The blueprint might be registered in the wrong order
4. **Tenant middleware**: Multi-tenant middleware might be blocking the request due to tenant context issues

## Bug Fix Verification

### Original Bug: `callAPI is not a function`
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Evidence**:
- No `callAPI is not a function` errors in console
- Export button successfully triggers API call
- Import button successfully triggers file chooser
- All JavaScript modules load and initialize correctly

**Conclusion**: The original JavaScript refactoring successfully fixed the `callAPI is not a function` error. However, a new critical issue has been discovered with the backend API endpoint.

---

## Recommendations

### Critical Priority (Fix Immediately)
1. **Fix Export API Endpoint 404 Error**:
   - Verify the export route has proper decorators (`@login_required`, `@admin_or_super_admin_required`, `@tenant_required`)
   - Check Flask route registration logs to confirm endpoint is registered
   - Test the endpoint directly with curl/Postman to isolate the issue
   - Review tenant middleware to ensure it's not blocking the request

### High Priority (Fix Before Deployment)
2. **Import Functionality Warning**:
   - Investigate "Import functionality temporarily unavailable" warning
   - Determine if import is actually disabled or if it's a stale warning message
   - Test import with a valid CSV file to verify end-to-end functionality

### Medium Priority (QA Testing)
3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Once export endpoint is fixed, test full export workflow
   - Test import workflow with various CSV formats
   - Test error handling for malformed CSV files
   - Test export/import with different user roles (ADMIN vs USER)

## Test Evidence

### Screenshots Location
All screenshots saved in: `/test-folder/screenshots/`

1. `assign-data-points-v2-initial-load.png` - Page loaded with 17 selected data points
2. `export-api-404-error.png` - Export button error state
3. `import-button-file-chooser.png` - Import button triggered file chooser

---

## Conclusion

The JavaScript bug fix (`callAPI is not a function`) has been **successfully resolved**. However, a **critical backend API issue** prevents the Export functionality from working. The Import functionality shows warning messages but opens the file chooser, indicating partial functionality.

**Overall Assessment**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION** until Export API endpoint 404 error is resolved.

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Backend developer to investigate and fix Export API 404 error
2. Backend developer to clarify Import "temporarily unavailable" status
3. Re-test both Export and Import after backend fixes are deployed
4. Conduct full regression testing of the assign-data-points-v2 interface
