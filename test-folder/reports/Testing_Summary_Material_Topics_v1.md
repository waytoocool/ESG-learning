# Testing Summary: Material Topic Assignment Feature

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Tester:** UI Testing Agent
**Feature:** Material Topic Assignment on Assign Data Points Page
**Test Environment:** http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2

---

## Test Objective

Debug and identify why assigned material topics don't update in the UI immediately after assignment.

---

## Test Results: FAILED

### Critical Bug Identified

The Material Topic Assignment feature is **completely non-functional** due to a JavaScript error that prevents configuration from being saved.

---

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: State Management Disconnect (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** Blocker
- **Description:** `AppState.selectedDataPoints` Map is empty even when checkboxes are checked in the DOM
- **Impact:** Configuration modal cannot read selected fields, causing JavaScript errors
- **Evidence:** Console shows `selectedDataPoints.size === 0` while DOM shows `checkedCheckboxes === 1`

### Issue 2: Apply Configuration Fails (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** Blocker
- **Description:** Clicking "Apply Configuration" throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- **Location:** `PopupsModule.js:563`
- **Impact:** No topics can be assigned, modal doesn't close, no data is saved

### Issue 3: Configure Button Doesn't Open Modal (HIGH)
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** "Configure Selected" toolbar button shows warning instead of opening modal
- **Error:** "Please select data points to configure" even when items are checked
- **Root Cause:** Same state management issue

### Issue 4: Individual Field Configure Button (MEDIUM)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Gear icon (⚙️) emits event but doesn't automatically open modal
- **Workaround:** Modal can be opened manually via Bootstrap API

## Screenshots Captured

All screenshots saved in: `/test-folder/screenshots/`

1. `01-initial-page-load.png` - Page successfully loads with data
2. `02-unassigned-section-visible.png` - 14 unassigned fields visible
3. `03-configuration-modal-open.png` - Modal opens (manual trigger)
4. `04-material-topic-section-visible.png` - Material Topic section visible
5. `05-topic-selected-emissions-tracking.png` - Topic successfully selected
6. `06-after-apply-clicked-error.png` - Error state: modal still open after failure

---

## Root Cause

**State Management Failure:** The checkbox event handler in `SelectedDataPointsPanel.js` does not properly update `AppState.selectedDataPoints` Map when checkboxes are toggled. This causes all downstream operations to fail because they depend on this Map to identify which fields are selected.

**Cascading Failures:**
1. Checkbox checked → AppState NOT updated
2. Configure button clicked → Finds 0 selected items → Shows warning
3. Gear icon clicked → Event emitted but modal logic broken
4. Apply Configuration → Tries to read from empty Map → TypeError

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Fix checkbox event handler** in `SelectedDataPointsPanel.js` to properly sync with `AppState.selectedDataPoints`
2. **Add defensive null checks** in `PopupsModule.js` at line 563 to prevent crashes
3. **Test the full flow** after fixes are applied

### Testing Priority

- **P0 (Blocker):** Fix state management and verify basic topic assignment works
- **P1 (High):** Ensure UI updates immediately after assignment (original issue)
- **P2 (Medium):** Test bulk operations with multiple fields
- **P3 (Low):** Verify edge cases (clearing topics, switching topics)

---

## Status

**BLOCKED** - Feature is completely non-functional and requires code fixes before further testing can proceed.

---

## Next Steps for Developer

1. Review the comprehensive bug report: `Bug_Report_Material_Topic_Assignment_v1.md`
2. Implement Fix #1 (checkbox handler sync)
3. Implement Fix #2 (defensive null check)
4. Re-test the complete flow
5. Verify UI immediate update requirement from original task
