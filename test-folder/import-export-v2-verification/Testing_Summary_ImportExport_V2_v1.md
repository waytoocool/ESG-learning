# Testing Summary: Import/Export V2 Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Feature**: Import/Export Functionality (V2 Version)
**URL**: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2
**Tester**: UI Testing Agent

---

## Summary

Conducted comprehensive testing of the V2 import/export functionality following reports that backend API endpoints had been fixed. Testing revealed a **critical blocking bug** that prevents the import feature from functioning.

---

## Test Results

| Component | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Export** | ✅ PASS | Successfully exported 21 records to CSV |
| **Import Validation** | ✅ PASS | CSV validation successful (21 valid, 0 errors) |
| **Import Execution** | ❌ FAIL | **ALL 21 records failed with HTTP 404 errors** |

---

## Critical Bug Found

**Issue**: Backend API endpoint route registration mismatch

**Details**:
- Frontend calls: `PUT /admin/api/assignments/version/{id}/supersede`
- Backend route exists at: `PUT /api/assignments/version/{id}/supersede`
- Result: **HTTP 404 NOT FOUND** for all import operations

**Impact**: Import functionality is completely non-functional. Feature is **NOT production ready**.

**Root Cause**: The supersede endpoint is registered on `versioning_api_bp` (prefix `/api/assignments`) but needs to also be on `assignment_api_bp` (prefix `/admin/api/assignments`) to match frontend expectations.

---

## Required Action

**Immediate Fix Required**:
1. Register supersede endpoint on `assignment_api_bp` blueprint
2. Verify endpoint accessible at `/admin/api/assignments/version/{id}/supersede`
3. Re-test import functionality

**Files Affected**:
- `/app/routes/admin_assignments_api.py` - Add route registration

---

## Evidence

**Screenshots**: 5 screenshots captured in `screenshots/` folder
- Initial page load
- Export success
- Import validation modal
- Import failure state

**Network Logs**: Documented all API calls showing:
- Export endpoint: 200 OK ✅
- By-field queries: 200 OK ✅ (21 successful calls)
- Supersede calls: 404 NOT FOUND ❌ (21 failed calls)

**Detailed Report**: `V2_Import_Export_Test_Report_CRITICAL_BUG_FOUND.md`

---

## Comparison with Previous Test

Previous testing also identified 404 errors on versioning endpoints. Despite claims of backend fixes, the same fundamental issue persists - the routes exist but are registered under the wrong URL prefix.

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT RELEASE** import functionality to production until backend route registration is fixed. Export functionality can be released independently as it works correctly.

---

**Next Steps**: Backend developer to fix route registration, then request re-test of import functionality.
