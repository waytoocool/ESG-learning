**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Tester**: UI Testing Agent
**Test Environment**: test-company-alpha
**Test User**: alice@alpha.com (ADMIN)
**Page Tested**: `/admin/assign-data-points-v2`
**Verification Type**: Regression Testing (Post Bug Fix)

---

## Executive Summary

**Verification Status**: RESOLVED
**Overall Result**: PASS - All critical issues fixed successfully

The soft delete functionality has been successfully implemented in the assign-data-points-v2 page. All three regression tests passed, confirming that the P0 critical bug identified in the original test run has been fully resolved. The delete button now correctly performs a soft delete (marking items as inactive) rather than a hard delete, visual indicators are properly displayed for inactive items, and the show/hide toggle functions as expected.

**Recommendation**: APPROVED for production deployment

## Original Issues (Before Fix)

Reference: `/test-folder/soft-delete-testing-2025-10-02/Testing_Summary_SoftDelete_v1.md`

### Issue 1: Hard Delete Instead of Soft Delete
- **Severity**: P0 (Critical)
- **Description**: Delete button completely removed items from UI state
- **Impact**: Data loss risk, no recovery mechanism, no audit trail

### Issue 2: No Visual Indicators for Inactive Items
- **Severity**: P0 (Critical)
- **Description**: Could not test visual indicators because no inactive items existed
- **Impact**: Users unable to distinguish inactive from active items

### Issue 3: Non-Functional Show/Hide Toggle
- **Severity**: P0 (Critical)
- **Description**: Toggle button changed state but had no effect (no inactive items to show/hide)
- **Impact**: Feature completely non-functional

### TEST 1: Delete Button Soft Delete Functionality

**Status**: PASS ✓

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigated to assign-data-points-v2 page
2. Verified 20 data points loaded
3. Clicked delete button on "Complete Framework Field 1"
4. Observed console logs and UI behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
- Item should be marked as inactive (`is_active: false`)
- Item should NOT be removed from selectedItems Map
- Item should be hidden from view (default state)
- Count should reflect active items only

**Actual Behavior:**
- Console log: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Soft deleting item (marking as inactive): b33f7556-17dd-49a8-80fe-f6f5bd893d51`
- Console log: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Count updated: {activeCount: 19, inactiveCount: 1, totalCount: 20, displayText: "19 selected"}`
- Console log: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Item marked as inactive: {fieldId: ..., activeCount: 19, totalCount: 20, inactiveCount: 1}`
- Item disappeared from view (hidden, not removed)
- "Energy Management" topic group hidden (contained only the inactive item)
- Event emitted: `selected-panel-item-deactivated` (not `item-removed`)

**Evidence:**
- Screenshot: `screenshots/01-initial-state-20-items.png` - Before delete (20 items, "Complete Framework Field 1" visible)
- Screenshot: `screenshots/02-after-delete-item-hidden.png` - After delete (item hidden, 19 visible)

**Verification:**
- Item is NOT permanently deleted from Map ✓
- Item has `is_active: false` flag ✓
- Item has `deleted_at` timestamp ✓
- Count shows 19 active (not 20 total) ✓
- Soft delete behavior confirmed ✓

**Comparison with Original Test:**
- **BEFORE FIX**: Item completely removed, count decreased to 19, item unrecoverable
- **AFTER FIX**: Item marked inactive, stays in Map, recoverable via "Show Inactive"

**Result**: RESOLVED - Soft delete working as expected

### TEST 2: Inactive Item Visual Indicators

**Status**: PASS ✓

**Test Steps:**
1. After deleting "Complete Framework Field 1"
2. Clicked "Show Inactive" button
3. Observed visual styling of inactive item

**Expected Behavior:**
- Inactive items should have distinct visual markers:
  - Reduced opacity or grayed out appearance
  - "Inactive" badge (red/pink color)
  - Strikethrough or muted text
  - Different background color

**Actual Behavior:**
- "Energy Management" topic group REAPPEARED
- "Complete Framework Field 1" visible with visual indicators:
  - Red/pink "Inactive" badge displayed below field name ✓
  - Item text appears grayed out/faded compared to active items ✓
  - Reduced opacity applied to entire item ✓
  - Clear visual distinction from active items ✓

**Evidence:**
- Screenshot: `screenshots/03-show-inactive-with-visual-indicators.png` - Shows inactive item with all visual markers

**Visual Indicators Observed:**
1. Badge Text: "Inactive" in red/pink color
2. Text Color: Lighter gray compared to active items
3. Opacity: Visibly reduced (appears faded)
4. Background: Slightly different from active items
5. Clear Visual Separation: Easy to distinguish from active items

**Comparison with Original Test:**
- **BEFORE FIX**: Could not test - no inactive items existed
- **AFTER FIX**: All visual indicators working perfectly

**Result**: RESOLVED - Visual indicators fully functional

---

### TEST 3: Show/Hide Inactive Toggle Functionality

**Status**: PASS ✓

**Test Steps:**
1. Started with inactive item hidden (default state)
2. Clicked "Show Inactive" button
3. Verified inactive item appeared with visual markers
4. Clicked "Hide Inactive" button
5. Verified inactive item disappeared again

**Expected Behavior:**
- Default state: Button shows "Show Inactive", inactive items hidden
- After click: Button changes to "Hide Inactive", inactive items visible
- After second click: Button changes back to "Show Inactive", inactive items hidden
- Count display should update appropriately

**Actual Behavior - Show Inactive:**
- Button text changed from "Show Inactive" to "Hide Inactive" ✓
- Button icon changed from eye to eye-slash ✓
- Button gained active/darker background color ✓
- "Energy Management" topic group reappeared ✓
- "Complete Framework Field 1" visible with inactive badge ✓
- Console log: `[AppEvents] inactive-toggle-changed: {showInactive: true, visibleItemCount: 20}` ✓
- Console log: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Count updated: {activeCount: 19, inactiveCount: 1, totalCount: 20, displayText: "19 active, 1 inactive"}` ✓

**Actual Behavior - Hide Inactive:**
- Button text changed from "Hide Inactive" to "Show Inactive" ✓
- Button icon changed from eye-slash back to eye ✓
- Button lost active background color ✓
- "Energy Management" topic group disappeared ✓
- "Complete Framework Field 1" no longer visible ✓
- Console log: `[AppEvents] inactive-toggle-changed: {showInactive: false, visibleItemCount: 19}` ✓
- Console log: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Count updated: {activeCount: 19, inactiveCount: 1, totalCount: 20, displayText: "19 selected"}` ✓

**Evidence:**
- Screenshot: `screenshots/02-after-delete-item-hidden.png` - Default state (inactive hidden)
- Screenshot: `screenshots/03-show-inactive-with-visual-indicators.png` - Show inactive state
- Screenshot: `screenshots/04-hide-inactive-item-hidden-again.png` - Hide inactive state

**Count Display Behavior:**
- When hiding inactive: Shows "19 selected" (active count only)
- When showing inactive: Console shows "19 active, 1 inactive" (though UI shows total count in header)

**Comparison with Original Test:**
- **BEFORE FIX**: Toggle button changed state but had no effect (no items to show/hide)
- **AFTER FIX**: Toggle works perfectly, controls visibility as expected

**Result**: RESOLVED - Toggle functionality fully working
