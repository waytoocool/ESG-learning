# Testing Summary: Soft Delete Functionality - Assign Data Points V2

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Tester**: UI Testing Agent
**Test Environment**: test-company-alpha
**Test User**: alice@alpha.com (ADMIN)
**Pages Tested**:
- `/admin/assign-data-points-v2` (NEW modular implementation)
- `/admin/assign_data_points_redesigned` (REFERENCE implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

**Test Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Overall Result**: FAIL - Soft delete functionality not properly implemented

The assign-data-points-v2 page does **NOT** implement soft delete functionality as expected. The delete button performs a **HARD DELETE** (complete removal from UI state) rather than a **SOFT DELETE** (marking items as inactive while preserving them in the system).

---

## Test Scope

This testing focused on validating three key functionalities:

1. **Soft Delete Functionality** - Verify delete button marks items as inactive (not permanent deletion)
2. **Inactive Item Visual Indicators** - Verify inactive items have distinct visual styling
3. **Show/Hide Inactive Toggle** - Verify toggle button shows/hides inactive items

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Delete Button Behavior (CRITICAL ISSUE)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Clicking delete button should perform a SOFT DELETE
- Item should remain in the system but marked as `is_active: false`
- Item should remain visible when "Show Inactive" is enabled
- Visual indicators should show item is inactive (reduced opacity, badge, strikethrough, etc.)

**Actual Behavior**:
- Clicking delete button performs a HARD DELETE
- Item is completely removed from UI state
- Item count decreases (20 → 19 data points)
- Item is NOT recoverable via "Show Inactive" toggle

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `page-2025-10-02T09-51-33-153Z.png` - Before delete (20 items, "Complete Framework Field 1" visible)
- Screenshot: `page-2025-10-02T09-52-12-546Z.png` - After delete (19 items, "Complete Framework Field 1" completely removed)
- Console logs show: `[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Remove clicked for: b33f7556-17dd-49a8-80fe-f6f5bd893d51`
- Followed by: `datapoint-removed: {fieldId: b33f7556-17dd-49a8-80fe-f6f5bd893d51}`

**Code Analysis**:
```javascript
// From SelectedDataPointsPanel.js, line 243-254
removeItem(fieldId) {
    console.log('[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Removing item:', fieldId);

    if (!this.selectedItems.has(fieldId)) {
        console.log('[SelectedDataPointsPanel] Item not found for removal:', fieldId);
        return;
    }

    this.selectedItems.delete(fieldId);  // HARD DELETE - completely removes from Map

    // Update display
    this.updateDisplay();

    AppEvents.emit('selected-panel-item-removed', {
        fieldId: fieldId,
        count: this.selectedItems.size
    });

    AppEvents.emit('datapoint-removed', { fieldId: fieldId });
    AppEvents.emit('selected-panel-count-changed', { count: this.selectedItems.size });
}
```

**Problem**: The `removeItem()` method uses `this.selectedItems.delete(fieldId)` which completely removes the item from the Map. For soft delete, it should instead:
1. Mark the item as inactive: `itemData.is_active = false`
2. Keep the item in the Map
3. Update display to show/hide based on `showInactive` state

---

### 2. Inactive Item Visual Indicators (NOT TESTABLE)

**Status**: Cannot test due to Soft Delete not being implemented

**Expected Behavior**:
- Inactive items should have distinct visual styling:
  - Reduced opacity (e.g., `opacity: 0.6`)
  - Strikethrough text
  - "Inactive" badge
  - Different background color
  - Disabled state appearance

**Actual Behavior**:
- No inactive items exist in the system to test visual indicators
- When item is "deleted", it's completely removed (hard delete)
- Therefore, no visual indicators for inactive state can be observed

**Note**: This functionality cannot be validated until soft delete is properly implemented.

---

### 3. Show/Hide Inactive Toggle (PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL)

**Status**: Toggle button exists and changes state, but has no effect

**Expected Behavior**:
- Button starts as "Show Inactive" with eye icon
- Clicking changes to "Hide Inactive" with eye-slash icon
- When "Show Inactive" mode: displays both active and inactive items
- When "Hide Inactive" mode: displays only active items
- Inactive items should have visual indicators

**Actual Behavior**:
- Button correctly toggles between "Show Inactive" ↔ "Hide Inactive"
- Button visual state changes (icon changes, active state applied)
- Console logs confirm toggle: `inactive-toggle-changed: {showInactive: true, visibleItemCount: 19}`
- However, **NO change in displayed items** because no inactive items exist
- The toggle mechanism works, but has nothing to show/hide

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `page-2025-10-02T09-52-27-826Z.png` - Shows "HIDE INACTIVE" button active
- Item count remains 19 (no additional inactive items shown)

**Code Analysis**:
```javascript
// From SelectedDataPointsPanel.js, line 106-110
if (this.elements.toggleInactiveButton) {
    this.elements.toggleInactiveButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        this.handleToggleInactive();
    });
}
```

The toggle event handler exists and fires correctly. However, the implementation needs to:
1. Filter items based on `is_active` status when rendering
2. Show all items when `showInactive = true`
3. Filter out inactive items when `showInactive = false`

---

### 4. Comparison with Reference Implementation

**Reference Page**: `/admin/assign_data_points_redesigned`

**Observations**:
- Reference implementation loaded successfully
- Shows 20 data points selected (same test data)
- Has identical "Show Inactive" button
- Uses different grouping method (displays framework names in topic headers)
- Likely has the same soft delete issue (needs separate investigation)

**Key Differences**:
- v2 page groups by topic only: "Energy Management"
- Reference page groups by topic + framework: "Energy Management (Framework)"
- Both pages have the same button layout and functionality
- Both appear to have the same underlying delete mechanism

**Note**: Reference implementation was not tested for soft delete behavior in this session due to time constraints and focus on v2 implementation.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The soft delete functionality is not implemented in the current codebase. The issues stem from:

### 1. **JavaScript Implementation Gap**

The `SelectedDataPointsPanel.removeItem()` method performs a hard delete:
```javascript
this.selectedItems.delete(fieldId);  // Removes entirely from Map
```

Should be:
```javascript
const item = this.selectedItems.get(fieldId);
if (item) {
    item.is_active = false;  // Mark as inactive
    item.deleted_at = new Date();  // Track deletion time
    this.updateDisplay();  // Re-render with inactive state
}
```

### 2. **Display Logic Missing**

The `updateDisplay()` and rendering methods don't filter based on `is_active` status:
- Need to check `showInactive` state
- Need to filter items by `is_active` when rendering
- Need to apply inactive visual styles

### 3. **Backend Integration Unclear**

- Code references `includeInactive` parameter in `ServicesModule.loadExistingDataPointsWithInactive()`
- Suggests backend may support soft delete
- But frontend doesn't properly integrate this functionality

---

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH (P0 - Critical Feature Gap)

**User Impact**:
- Users cannot recover accidentally deleted assignments
- No audit trail of deleted items
- Loss of data when items are removed
- Cannot view history of inactive assignments

**Business Impact**:
- Data integrity concerns
- Compliance/audit issues (no deletion trail)
- Workflow disruption (cannot temporarily deactivate items)
- User frustration (permanent deletion without warning)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Implement Soft Delete in SelectedDataPointsPanel**
   - Modify `removeItem()` to mark `is_active: false` instead of deleting
   - Update `handleToggleInactive()` to properly filter items
   - Add visual indicators for inactive items

2. **Update Display Rendering**
   - Filter items based on `showInactive` state
   - Apply inactive visual styles (opacity, badge, etc.)
   - Maintain item count accuracy (show active vs. total)

3. **Add Confirmation Dialog**
   - Confirm before marking items inactive
   - Explain that item will be deactivated, not permanently deleted
   - Provide option to permanently delete if needed

### Short-term Actions (P1)

4. **Enhance Visual Indicators**
   - Add "INACTIVE" badge to inactive items
   - Reduce opacity to 0.6
   - Add strikethrough or grayed-out appearance
   - Consider adding "Restore" button for inactive items

5. **Update UI Labels**
   - Change "Delete" button tooltip to "Deactivate" or "Archive"
   - Update button icon to reflect soft delete action
   - Add help text explaining inactive vs. deleted

### Medium-term Actions (P2)

6. **Backend Sync Verification**
   - Verify backend properly supports soft delete
   - Ensure `is_active` field is persisted to database
   - Test data recovery after page refresh

7. **Add Restore Functionality**
   - Add "Restore" button for inactive items
   - Implement restore action to set `is_active: true`
   - Update UI to reflect restored state

## Next Steps

1. **Bug Report**: Create detailed bug report for soft delete implementation
2. **Code Review**: Review both v2 and reference implementations for consistency
3. **Backend Verification**: Test backend API endpoints for soft delete support
4. **Fix Implementation**: Implement proper soft delete in SelectedDataPointsPanel
5. **Visual Design**: Create inactive item visual specifications
6. **Regression Testing**: Test all CRUD operations after fix
7. **Reference Page Testing**: Verify reference implementation has same behavior

---

## Conclusion

The assign-data-points-v2 page **DOES NOT** implement soft delete functionality. The delete button performs a hard delete, removing items entirely from the UI state. The "Show Inactive" toggle exists but has no inactive items to display. This represents a critical gap in the implementation that should be addressed before production deployment.

**Status**: **BLOCKED** - Feature not implemented
**Priority**: **P0** - Critical functionality gap
**Recommendation**: **DO NOT PROCEED** to production without implementing soft delete
