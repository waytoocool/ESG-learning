# Soft Delete Functionality Testing - October 2, 2025

## Test Overview

This folder contains the comprehensive testing results for the soft delete functionality on the assign-data-points-v2 page.

**Test Date**: October 2, 2025
**Test Environment**: test-company-alpha
**Tester**: UI Testing Agent
**Test Duration**: ~30 minutes

---

## Test Results Summary

**Overall Status**: FAIL - Critical Issue Identified
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Recommendation**: DO NOT PROCEED to production

### Critical Finding

The assign-data-points-v2 page **DOES NOT implement soft delete functionality**. The delete button performs a **HARD DELETE** instead of marking items as inactive.

Visual evidence of testing:
- `page-2025-10-02T09-51-33-153Z.png` - V2 page initial load (20 items)
- `page-2025-10-02T09-52-12-546Z.png` - V2 page after delete (19 items, item removed)
- `page-2025-10-02T09-52-27-826Z.png` - V2 page with "Hide Inactive" active
- `page-2025-10-02T09-53-01-665Z.png` - Reference implementation page

## Key Findings

### 1. Delete Button Behavior (CRITICAL)
- **Expected**: Soft delete (mark as inactive)
- **Actual**: Hard delete (complete removal)
- **Impact**: Data loss, no recovery mechanism
- **Status**: FAIL

### 2. Inactive Item Visual Indicators
- **Expected**: Reduced opacity, badges, styling for inactive items
- **Actual**: No inactive items exist to test (due to hard delete)
- **Status**: NOT TESTABLE

### 3. Show/Hide Inactive Toggle
- **Expected**: Toggle visibility of inactive items
- **Actual**: Toggle button works but has no inactive items to show/hide
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL (mechanism works, but no data)

## Technical Details

### Affected Files
- `/app/static/js/admin/assign_data_points/SelectedDataPointsPanel.js` (main issue)
- `/app/static/js/admin/assign_data_points/ServicesModule.js` (related)
- `/app/templates/admin/assign_data_points_v2.html` (UI)

### Root Cause
The `SelectedDataPointsPanel.removeItem()` method uses:
```javascript
this.selectedItems.delete(fieldId);  // HARD DELETE
```

Should use:
```javascript
item.is_active = false;  // SOFT DELETE
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P0)
1. Implement soft delete in SelectedDataPointsPanel.removeItem()
2. Update display logic to filter by is_active status
3. Add visual indicators for inactive items

### Short-term (P1)
4. Add confirmation dialog before deletion
5. Enhance visual indicators (badges, opacity, strikethrough)
6. Update UI labels and tooltips

### Medium-term (P2)
7. Verify backend soft delete support
8. Add restore functionality for inactive items
9. Test reference implementation for consistency

---

## Next Steps

1. Review bug report and testing summary
2. Prioritize fix implementation
3. Assign to development team
4. Implement proposed solutions
5. Re-test after fix
6. Verify backend integration
7. Test reference implementation
