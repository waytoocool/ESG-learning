# Export Functionality Quick Test Report
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Test URL**: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2
**Login**: alice@alpha.com / admin123
**Flask App Status**: Running (restarted)

---

## Test Objective
Quick re-test of Export functionality after Flask app restart to verify if the 404 error persists.

---

## Test Steps Performed
1. Killed existing Chrome processes
2. Verified Flask app is running
3. Logged in as alice@alpha.com (Admin user for Test Company Alpha)
4. Navigated to Assign Data Points v2 page
5. Clicked "Export" button
6. Monitored browser console and network requests

---

## Test Results

### Status: FAILED - 404 Error Persists

The Export functionality is still broken after Flask restart. The issue is a **URL path problem** in the JavaScript code.

---

## Root Cause Identified

### Issue: Double `/admin` Prefix in API Calls

The JavaScript is incorrectly constructing the API endpoint URL with a duplicate `/admin` prefix.

**Expected Endpoint**:
```
http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/api/assignments/export
```

**Actual Endpoint Being Called**:
```
http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/admin/api/assignments/export
```

### Network Request Evidence
```
[GET] http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/admin/api/assignments/export => [404] NOT FOUND
[GET] http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/admin/api/assignments/export => [404] NOT FOUND
```

The export endpoint was called twice (likely due to double-click or event bubbling), both returning 404.

### Additional Affected Endpoint
The same issue affects the Assignment History endpoint:
```
[GET] http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/admin/api/assignments/history?page=1&per_page=20 => [404] NOT FOUND
```

## Console Error Messages

### Export Errors
```javascript
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND)
[ERROR] [ServicesModule] API call failed: /admin/api/assignments/export Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[LOG] [ServicesModule] ERROR: API Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[LOG] [AppEvents] message-shown: {message: API Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND, type: error}
[ERROR] [ImportExportModule] Error fetching assignments: Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[ERROR] [ImportExportModule] Export error: Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[LOG] [ServicesModule] ERROR: Export failed: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
```

### History Loading Error
```javascript
[ERROR] [ServicesModule] API call failed: /admin/api/assignments/history?page=1&per_page=20 Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[LOG] [ServicesModule] ERROR: API Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
[ERROR] [HistoryModule] Error loading history: Error: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND
```

## User Impact

### What Users See
1. Page loads normally with 17 existing data points loaded
2. When clicking "Export" button:
   - Brief "Preparing export..." info message appears
   - Followed by error message: "Export failed: HTTP 404: NOT FOUND"
   - No CSV file downloads
   - No data exported

### What Works
- Page loads successfully
- Data points load correctly (19 assignments loaded)
- Frameworks and topics load properly
- Other functionality appears intact

### What's Broken
- Export functionality (404 error)
- Assignment History loading (404 error on page load)

---

## Technical Analysis

### Suspected Code Location
The issue is in the JavaScript API service module that constructs API URLs. It's likely in:
- `app/static/js/admin/assign_data_points/ServicesModule.js`
- Or a base URL configuration being used by both ImportExportModule and HistoryModule

### URL Construction Problem
The JavaScript is probably doing something like:
```javascript
const baseUrl = '/admin'; // Already has /admin
const apiPath = '/admin/api/assignments/export'; // Also starts with /admin
const fullUrl = baseUrl + apiPath; // Results in /admin/admin/api/assignments/export
```

### Fix Required
The API path construction needs to be corrected to avoid the duplicate `/admin` prefix. Either:
1. Remove `/admin` from the API path constants, OR
2. Don't prepend the base URL if the path already starts with `/admin`

---

## Conclusion

**The Export functionality is still broken after Flask restart.** This confirms the issue is in the **JavaScript code**, not a Flask server-side problem.

The root cause is a URL path construction bug creating duplicate `/admin` prefixes in API endpoint URLs.

---

## Next Steps

1. Review `ServicesModule.js` API URL construction logic
2. Fix the double `/admin` prefix issue
3. Apply the same fix to History endpoint calls
4. Re-test both Export and History functionality
5. Verify all other API endpoints aren't affected by the same issue
