# Testing Summary: Inactive Field Reactivation & Versioning

**Test Date:** October 2, 2025
**Test Page:** assign-data-points-v2
**Test Status:** COMPLETED
**Critical Bug Found:** YES

---

## Quick Summary

Tested the reported bug about assignment history versioning but discovered a **different, more critical bug**: inactive fields do NOT reactivate when entities are assigned to them.

---

## Test Results

### Original Bug Report: NOT CONFIRMED
- **Reported Issue:** Assignment history shows all versions as active when field is reactivated
- **Test Finding:** Assignment history correctly displays version statuses (inactive, active, superseded)
- **Verdict:** Working as expected

### New Bug Discovered: CONFIRMED (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Issue:** Inactive fields remain inactive after entity assignment
- **Expected:** Field should become active when entity is assigned
- **Actual:** Field stays inactive with "Inactive" badge displayed
- **Impact:** Blocks admin workflow for reactivating deleted fields

---

## Test Phases Executed

1. **Phase 1: Create Inactive Field** - PASSED
   - Soft-deleted "Complete Framework Field 1"
   - Field correctly marked as inactive with badge

2. **Phase 2: Attempt Reactivation** - FAILED
   - Assigned "Alpha Factory" entity to inactive field
   - Field remained inactive (BUG)

3. **Phase 3: Check Assignment History** - PASSED
   - Verified version history displays correctly
   - All status labels accurate

4. **Phase 4: Network Analysis** - COMPLETED
   - All API calls successful (200 OK)
   - No console errors

5. **Phase 5: Root Cause Analysis** - COMPLETED
   - Backend logic issue identified
   - Field status flag not updated during assignment

---

## Key Findings

**Bug Type:** Backend logic bug - reactivation workflow failure

**Affected Component:** Assignment creation logic in `admin_assign_data_points.py`

**Evidence:**
- Field shows "Inactive" badge after entity assignment
- Console: `activeCount: 19, inactiveCount: 1` (should be 20/0)
- Assignment history shows new active version (v4) but field itself stays inactive

**Screenshots:** 6 screenshots captured in `/screenshots/` folder

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix:** Update assignment creation logic to set `is_active = True` when assigning entity to inactive field
2. **Add Validation:** Ensure field status synchronizes with assignment status
3. **UI Enhancement:** Add success message for reactivation
4. **Testing:** Add regression tests for reactivation workflow

---

## Severity Assessment

**Priority:** HIGH
**Reason:** Blocks core admin functionality - admins cannot reactivate previously deleted fields

**Workaround:** Delete and recreate field assignments (loses history continuity)
