## Test Execution Summary

### Phases Completed

1. **Phase 1: Version Discovery** ✓
   - Found field with multiple versions (v1-v5)
   - Confirmed v5 as highest version in system
   - Documented baseline state

2. **Phase 2: Pre-Test Verification** ✓
   - Confirmed all versions inactive (soft deleted)
   - Verified field appears in unassigned section
   - No active assignments exist

3. **Phase 3: Bug Reproduction** ✓
   - Selected field via checkbox
   - Clicked toolbar "Assign Entity" button
   - Assigned to Alpha Factory entity
   - Assignment completed successfully

4. **Phase 4: Version Verification** ✓
   - Checked Assignment History
   - **BUG CONFIRMED**: v1 active instead of v5

5. **Phase 5: Evidence Collection** ✓
   - Captured complete version history
   - Documented all inactive versions
   - Collected 8+ screenshots

6. **Phase 6: Technical Analysis** ✓
   - Reviewed console logs
   - Analyzed API responses
   - No frontend errors observed

7. **Phase 7: Root Cause Analysis** ✓
   - Identified missing version selection logic
   - Backend issue in assignment API
   - Frontend does not query for existing versions

8. **Phase 8: Documentation** ✓
   - Created comprehensive bug report
   - Documented reproduction steps
   - Provided recommended fixes

## Test Results

### Bug Confirmation

**Bug Status**: **CONFIRMED** ✓

**Test Field**: Complete Framework Field 1 (COMPLETE_FRAMEWORK_F1)
**Test Entity**: Alpha Factory
**Expected Result**: v5 or v6 assignment
**Actual Result**: v1 assignment
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Version history integrity compromised

### Key Findings

1. **Version Selection Failure**
   - System creates v1 assignment for field with existing v1-v5 versions
   - Highest existing version (v5) is ignored
   - No logic to determine latest version before assignment

2. **Data Integrity Impact**
   - Multiple v1 assignments exist for same field (different entities)
   - Version progression is non-sequential
   - Assignment History shows fragmented version timeline

3. **User Experience Impact**
   - Admins cannot rely on version numbers for tracking changes
   - Confusion about which version represents latest configuration
   - Audit trail is misleading

## Conclusions

1. **Bug is Real and Reproducible**
   - Successfully reproduced bug on first attempt
   - Behavior is consistent and predictable
   - Issue exists in backend version selection logic

2. **High Severity Issue**
   - Affects data integrity and version tracking
   - Impacts all fields with multiple versions
   - No workaround available in UI

3. **Clear Root Cause**
   - Backend does not query for existing versions
   - Default version (v1) is always used
   - Frontend has no version validation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Backend Version Logic**
   - Add query for existing versions before assignment
   - Implement version selection algorithm
   - Return version information in API response

2. **Add Frontend Validation**
   - Display version number in assignment modal
   - Show existing version count before assignment
   - Validate version in success message

3. **Improve Testing**
   - Add unit tests for version selection logic
   - Add integration tests for entity assignment workflow
   - Test edge cases (no versions, single version, multiple versions)

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Version Management UI**
   - Add version preview in assignment interface
   - Allow admins to choose version behavior (reactivate vs. new version)
   - Display version diff before assignment

2. **Audit Trail Enhancement**
   - Log version selection decisions
   - Track version reactivation events
   - Add version change notifications

---

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Developer**: Review and fix version selection logic in assignment API
2. **Code Review**: Review similar workflows for same issue
3. **Regression Testing**: Test fix across all assignment workflows
4. **Documentation Update**: Update API documentation with version handling
