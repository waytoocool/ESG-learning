# Testing Summary: Import Feature

**Test Date:** 2025-10-04
**Tested By:** ui-testing-agent (Claude Code)
**Test Scope:** Import Preview Modal Functionality
**Environment:** Admin Assign Data Points Page

---

## Test Objective

Validate the import preview modal functionality after user selects a CSV file for bulk assignment import.

---

## Test Execution

### Test Setup
- **User Role:** ADMIN
- **Login:** alice@alpha.com / admin123
- **URL:** http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points
- **Test File:** test_import.csv (2 valid records)

### Test Steps Performed

1. ✅ Successfully logged in as admin user
2. ✅ Navigated to Assign Data Points page
3. ✅ Clicked Import button in toolbar
4. ✅ File chooser opened correctly
5. ✅ Selected test CSV file
6. ❌ **FAILED:** Import preview modal did not appear

---

## Test Results

### Overall Status: FAILED

**Critical Issue Identified:** Import preview modal is invisible due to missing CSS class.

### What Works
- Import button clickable and responsive
- File chooser opens correctly
- File is read and parsed successfully
- CSV validation logic executes correctly
- Modal DOM element is created with correct content
- No JavaScript errors in console

### What Doesn't Work
- **Modal visibility:** Modal has opacity: 0, completely invisible to user
- **No user feedback:** User has no indication file was processed
- **Cannot proceed:** User cannot review or confirm import
- **Cannot cancel:** User cannot dismiss invisible modal

---

## Technical Findings

### Root Cause
JavaScript function `showImportPreview()` sets `display: flex` but fails to add the `.show` CSS class required to set `opacity: 1`.

### Evidence
- **DOM Inspection:** Modal exists with correct data
- **Computed Styles:** display=flex, opacity=0 (should be opacity=1)
- **Console Logs:** "[ImportExportModule] Showing import preview" logged
- **Visual Confirmation:** Screenshots show modal invisible

### Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH - Feature completely blocked
- **User Impact:** Cannot use import functionality at all
- **Workaround:** None available

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix Required:** Add `.show` class when displaying modal
2. **Code Location:** `/app/static/js/admin/assign_data_points/ImportExportModule.js`, line ~539
3. **Estimated Fix Time:** 5 minutes (simple one-line addition)
4. **Retest Required:** Full import workflow after fix
