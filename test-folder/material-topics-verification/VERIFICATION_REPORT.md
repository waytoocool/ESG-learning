## Root Cause Analysis (Fixed Issue)

### Previous Problem:
The material topics dropdown was empty because the `loadCompanyTopics()` function was not being called during the PopupsModule initialization phase.

### Fix Applied:
Added `await this.loadCompanyTopics();` to the `initialize()` method in PopupsModule, ensuring topics are loaded when the module initializes on page load.

### Verification:
The console logs confirm the fix is working:
1. Module initializes
2. Topics loading starts immediately
3. Topics successfully fetched from API
4. Dropdown populated with 5 topics
5. Topics remain available when modal opens

---

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Tested on Chromium (via Playwright)
- Expected to work on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

---

## Performance Notes

- Topics load asynchronously during page initialization
- No noticeable delay in dropdown population
- Modal opens instantly with pre-loaded topics
- Configuration saves quickly without lag

---

## Conclusion

The material topics loading fix is **fully functional** and working as expected. All test criteria have been met:

1. ✅ Topics load automatically on page initialization
2. ✅ Console logs confirm successful loading
3. ✅ Dropdown is populated with all 5 company topics
4. ✅ Topics are selectable from the dropdown
5. ✅ Configuration saves successfully without errors
6. ✅ No JavaScript errors or API failures

**Recommendation**: This fix is ready for production deployment.

## Additional Notes
