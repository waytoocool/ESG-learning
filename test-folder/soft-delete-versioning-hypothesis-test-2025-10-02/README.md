# Soft Delete & Versioning Bug Test - October 2, 2025

## Test Summary

**Status:** ✅ BUG CONFIRMED

This test validated the user's hypothesis about soft delete and assignment versioning behavior in the assign-data-points-v2 system. The bug has been confirmed and documented.

## Bug Description

When a framework field is soft deleted in assign-data-points-v2:
- ✅ The field correctly displays as "Inactive" in the UI
- ❌ **BUG**: All related assignment versions remain marked as "Active" in the assignment history
- ❌ Expected: All assignment versions should transition to "Inactive" when parent field is deleted

## Test Artifacts

### Documentation
1. **Hypothesis_Test_Report.md** - Comprehensive test report with findings, root cause analysis, and recommendations
2. **Version_Timeline.md** - Detailed version-by-version analysis and timeline
3. **README.md** - This file (test summary)

### Screenshots
All screenshots stored in `screenshots/` subfolder:

1. **01-initial-version-history-complete-framework-field-1.png**
   - Initial state before any changes
   - Shows 13 assignment versions with mixed statuses

2. **02-field-with-inactive-badge.png**
   - Field showing "Inactive" badge after soft delete
   - Confirms UI correctly reflects soft delete

3. **03-assignment-history-after-soft-delete-showing-bug.png**
   - Assignment history showing bug
   - Active versions (v5, v4, v3) still marked as "Active" instead of "Inactive"

## Key Findings

### What Works
- Field soft delete operation completes successfully
- Field displays "Inactive" badge in UI
- UI state correctly reflects field deletion

### What's Broken
- Assignment history does NOT update when field is deleted
- Active assignment versions remain as "Active" (should be "Inactive")
- Superseded versions remain as "Superseded" (should be "Inactive")
- Creates data inconsistency between field status and assignment status

### Impact
- **Severity:** High
- **Priority:** High
- **Data Integrity:** Critical inconsistency between field and assignment states
- **User Confusion:** Assignment history shows incorrect status
- **Business Risk:** Users may attempt to enter data for deleted fields

## Root Cause

**Backend Bug:** Soft delete operation does not cascade to related DataPointAssignment records.

**Current Logic (Suspected):**
```python
# Only updates the field
field.is_active = False
```

**Required Logic:**
```python
# Should update field AND all related assignments
field.is_active = False
DataPointAssignment.query.filter_by(field_id=field.id).update({'is_active': False})
db.session.commit()
```

## Test Details

- **Field Tested:** Complete Framework Field 1 (ID: b33f7556-17dd-49a8-80fe-f6f5bd893d51)
- **Framework:** Complete Framework
- **Tenant:** Test Company Alpha
- **User:** alice@alpha.com (ADMIN)
- **Pages:** assign-data-points-v2, assignment-history
- **Total Versions Found:** 13 assignment records
- **Active Versions (Bug):** v5 (Alpha HQ), v4 (Alpha Factory), v3 (Alpha HQ - 2 entries)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Backend Fix:** Implement cascade logic for soft delete operations
2. **Data Migration:** Update existing orphaned assignments to inactive status
3. **Validation:** Add database constraints to prevent active assignments with inactive fields

### Follow-up (Medium Priority)
1. **Duplicate Version Investigation:** Investigate why v3 has duplicate Active entries
2. **Version Numbering Review:** Review version numbering logic for consistency
3. **UI Enhancement:** Show field deletion status in assignment history

### Long-term (Low Priority)
1. **Automated Tests:** Add E2E tests for soft delete scenarios
2. **Documentation:** Update developer docs with cascade delete patterns
3. **Audit Trail:** Log assignment status changes in audit log

## Test Execution Details

- **Test Duration:** ~15 minutes
- **Testing Tool:** Playwright MCP (browser automation)
- **Test Type:** Hypothesis validation, exploratory testing
- **Test Approach:** Live Environment First (UI testing before code review)

3. Examine screenshots for visual evidence
4. Implement recommended backend fix
5. Run database queries to verify current state
6. Test fix in development environment
7. Deploy fix to production
