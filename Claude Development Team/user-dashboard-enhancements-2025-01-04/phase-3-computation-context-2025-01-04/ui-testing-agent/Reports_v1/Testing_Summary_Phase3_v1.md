# Phase 3: Computation Context - UI Testing Summary

**Testing Date:** 2025-10-04
**Tester:** UI Testing Agent
**Test Environment:** V2 Dashboard - http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/user/v2/dashboard
**Test User:** bob@alpha.com (USER role)
**Test Entity:** Alpha Factory (Manufacturing)
**Flask App Status:** Running

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Test Status: ⚠️ **BLOCKED - CANNOT TEST**

**Critical Blocker:** Phase 3 Computation Context features **CANNOT be tested** because there are **ZERO computed fields** in the database. The Phase 3 implementation is complete and properly integrated, but the test environment lacks the necessary data to validate any functionality.

**Test Completion:** 0% (0 of 15 test sections completed)
**Reason:** No computed fields exist to trigger computation context modal

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. BLOCKER: No Computed Fields in Database ❌

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Complete testing blockage

**Evidence:**
- Dashboard shows: "**Computed Fields: 0**"
- Database query confirmed: **0 computed fields with `is_computed=True`**
- Message displayed: "No computed fields assigned to this entity."

**Database Query Results:**
```
Total computed fields in database: 0
Total assignments to Alpha Factory: 66
```

**What This Means:**
- All 20 assigned fields are **raw input fields** only
- No fields have `is_computed=True` or `formula_expression` set
- The "Formula" button (required for Phase 3 testing) never appears
- Computation context modal cannot be triggered
- All Phase 3 features are untestable without computed fields

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The seed data (`app/services/initial_data.py`) does not create any computed fields. It only creates:
- Raw framework fields with basic attributes
- Data point assignments
- But no fields with formulas or computation logic

---

## Required Actions to Unblock Testing

### Option 1: Create Sample Computed Fields (Recommended)

**Action Required:**
1. Update `app/services/initial_data.py` to create computed fields
2. Add fields with `is_computed=True` and `formula_expression` set
3. Create variable mappings for dependencies
4. Assign computed fields to test entities

**Example Computed Field:**
```python
# Field: Total Energy Consumption
field_code: "total_energy_consumption"
is_computed: True
formula_expression: "(A + B)"
variable_mappings: [
    {variable: 'A', field_code: 'grid_electricity'},
    {variable: 'B', field_code: 'renewable_energy'}
]
```

**Minimum Requirement:**
- At least **3-5 computed fields** with varying complexity
- At least **1 computed field assigned** to Alpha Factory entity
- At least **1 nested computed field** (computed field depending on another computed field)

### Option 2: Manual Database Seeding

**Action Required:**
1. Create SQL script to insert computed fields
2. Update FrameworkDataField table
3. Create FieldVariableMapping entries
4. Create DataPointAssignment entries
5. Restart Flask application

### Option 3: Admin Interface Seeding

**Action Required:**
1. Login as admin (alice@alpha.com)
2. Use admin frameworks interface to create computed fields
3. Assign computed fields to Alpha Factory
4. Return to user dashboard for testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Blocker Resolution)

1. **Create Computed Fields Seed Data** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Update `app/services/initial_data.py`
   - Add at least 5 computed fields with formulas
   - Assign to test entities
   - Include nested computed fields

2. **Populate Historical Data** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Create ESGData entries for computed fields over time
   - Minimum 12 data points for trend analysis
   - Include various calculation scenarios

3. **Create Test Scenarios** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Simple formula: `A + B`
   - Complex formula: `(A + B) / C * 1000`
   - Aggregation formula: `SUM(entity_field)`
   - Nested computed field: Depends on another computed field
   - Missing dependencies: Field with incomplete data

### Testing Preparation

4. **Document Test Computed Fields**
   - Create a reference document listing all test computed fields
   - Include field_id, formula, expected dependencies
   - Document expected calculation results

5. **Create API Test Script**
   - Prepare curl commands with actual field_ids
   - Test all 5 API endpoints
   - Verify response structures

### Post-Unblock Testing Strategy

6. **Phased Testing Approach**
   - Phase A: Basic modal functionality (open/close)
   - Phase B: Content rendering (formula, steps, dependencies)
   - Phase C: Interactive features (charts, hover states)
   - Phase D: Edge cases and error handling
   - Phase E: Responsive and accessibility testing

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Verification

**Tables Involved:**
- `framework_data_fields` - Must have fields with `is_computed=True`
- `field_variable_mappings` - Must have variable to field mappings
- `data_point_assignments` - Must assign computed fields to entities
- `esg_data` - Should have historical data for trend analysis

**Current State:**
```sql
-- Computed fields count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM framework_data_fields WHERE is_computed = 1;
-- Result: 0

-- Assignments to Alpha Factory (entity_id = 1)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data_point_assignments WHERE entity_id = 1;
-- Result: 66 (all raw fields)
```

### API Endpoint Verification (Cannot Test Without Data)

**Expected Request:**
```bash
curl "http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/user/v2/api/computation-context/<field_id>?entity_id=3&reporting_date=2025-10-04" \
  -H "Cookie: session=<session-cookie>"
```

**Expected Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "context": {
    "field": {...},
    "formula": "readable formula string",
    "dependencies": [...],
    "calculation_steps": [...],
    "historical_trend": {...},
    "status": "complete"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

### Summary

Phase 3 Computation Context implementation is **architecturally complete** with all required files, services, API endpoints, and UI components properly integrated. However, comprehensive UI testing **CANNOT proceed** due to the absence of computed fields in the test database.

### Key Points

1. ✅ **Implementation Quality:** All Phase 3 code is present and properly integrated
2. ❌ **Data Availability:** Zero computed fields exist in the database
3. ⚠️ **Testing Status:** 0% completion due to data blocker
4. 🔧 **Required Action:** Create sample computed fields with formulas
5. 📋 **Next Steps:** Unblock testing by seeding computed field data

### Risk Assessment

**Current Risk:** HIGH
**Reason:** Cannot validate that Phase 3 features work as intended
**Mitigation:** Create computed field seed data immediately

### Estimated Time to Unblock

- **Seed Data Creation:** 2-3 hours
- **Testing Execution:** 4-6 hours (once unblocked)
- **Total:** 6-9 hours from data creation to completion
