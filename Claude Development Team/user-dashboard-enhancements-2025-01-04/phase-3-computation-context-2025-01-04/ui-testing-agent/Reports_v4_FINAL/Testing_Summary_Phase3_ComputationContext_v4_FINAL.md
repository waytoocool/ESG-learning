## Tested Computed Fields

All 4 unique computed field types were tested successfully:

1. **Total Energy Consumption** (Addition formula)
   - Formula: `High Coverage Framework Field 1 + High Coverage Framework Field 10`
   - Status: Displays correctly with missing dependencies warning

2. **Energy Efficiency Ratio** (Division formula)
   - Formula: `High Coverage Framework Field 1 ÷ High Coverage Framework Field 10`
   - Status: Displays correctly with missing dependencies warning

3. **Average Resource Consumption** (Average formula)
   - Formula: Complex averaging calculation
   - Status: Displays correctly

4. **Complex Sustainability Index** (Multi-operator formula)
   - Formula: `(Field 1 + Field 10) × Field 2 ÷ Field 3`
   - Status: Displays correctly with 4 missing dependencies listed

## Browser Console Analysis

**Status:** ✅ CLEAN

Console output during testing:
```
[LOG] ✅ Global PopupManager initialized
[LOG] Login response: {success: true}

## Non-Functional Observations

### Positive Highlights
1. **Excellent User Experience**: Modal provides comprehensive computation context in an intuitive format
2. **Professional Design**: Clean, modern interface matching application branding
3. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation works perfectly (ESC key)
4. **Performance**: No lag or delays in modal operations
5. **Error Handling**: Clear messaging for missing dependencies

### Minor Polish Opportunities (Non-Blocking)
1. **Formula Display**: Consider syntax highlighting for complex formulas
2. **Dependency Tree**: Could add expand/collapse for deeply nested dependencies
3. **Mobile UX**: Consider bottom-sheet style modal for mobile devices
4. **Loading States**: Add skeleton loader while fetching data (if needed for slower networks)
