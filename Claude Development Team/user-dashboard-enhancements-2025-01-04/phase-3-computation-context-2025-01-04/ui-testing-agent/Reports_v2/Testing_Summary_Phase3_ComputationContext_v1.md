# Testing Summary: Phase 3 Computation Context Features
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Tester:** UI Testing Agent
**Test Environment:** Test Company Alpha - User Dashboard V2

---

## Test Status: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE

**Overall Result:** Phase 3 feature is **100% non-functional** due to backend bug
**Blocker:** Assignment resolution fails in multi-tenant web context
**Impact:** All Formula button clicks return HTTP 404

---

## Quick Summary

### What Was Tested
- **Environment:** http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/user/v2/dashboard
- **User:** bob@alpha.com (USER role)
- **Entity:** Alpha Factory (ID: 3)
- **Fields Tested:** 8 computed fields (Total Energy Consumption, Energy Efficiency Ratio, etc.)
- **Expected Feature:** Clicking "Formula" button should open modal with computation context

### What Works ✅
1. Dashboard displays 8 computed fields correctly
2. "Formula" buttons render next to each field
3. Button clicks trigger JavaScript handlers
4. API routes are registered (`/user/v2/api/computation-context/<field_id>`)
5. Authentication passes (user authorized for endpoint)
6. Service layer works correctly in Python shell (without web context)

### What's Broken ❌
1. **CRITICAL:** `resolve_assignment()` returns `None` when called via HTTP request
2. All Formula button clicks fail with `HTTP 404: No assignment found for this field`
3. No modals open
4. No user feedback shown
5. All 4 computed fields fail identically
6. 11 out of 15 test cases blocked by this single issue

## Root Cause

**Bug Location:** `/app/services/assignment_versioning.py` - `resolve_assignment()` function
**Problem:** Tenant middleware filters prevent assignment resolution in web request context
**Evidence:**
- Direct Python call (no tenant context): Returns assignment ✅
- HTTP request call (with tenant context): Returns None ❌
- Assignments exist in database for the correct company and entity
- Auth passes, but service fails before returning data

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "No assignment found for this field",
  "success": false
}
```

## Test Results Matrix

| Feature | Status | Note |
|---------|--------|------|
| Computed field display | ✅ PASS | 8 fields visible |
| "Formula" button visibility | ✅ PASS | All buttons render |
| Modal opening | ❌ FAIL | API returns 404 |
| Formula display | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Dependency tree | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Historical trend chart | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Modal closing | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Calculation steps | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Trend analysis | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Status badges | ❌ BLOCKED | Modal doesn't open |
| Responsive design | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test UI |
| Multiple fields | ❌ FAIL | All 4 fail identically |
| API response structure | ❌ FAIL | 404 instead of 200 |
| Missing dependencies warning | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test edge cases |
| Error handling | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Error caught but not shown to user |

**Pass Rate:** 2/15 (13.3%)
**Blocked:** 11/15 (73.3%)
**Failed:** 2/15 (13.3%)

## Screenshots

1. **01-dashboard-initial-state.png** - Dashboard loads correctly with computed fields visible
2. **02-formula-button-404-error.png** - No visible change after clicking Formula (silent failure)
3. **03-browser-console-errors.png** - Console shows HTTP 404 errors

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix Required (P0)
1. Debug `resolve_assignment()` function in tenant-scoped web request context
2. Fix tenant filtering logic for computed field assignments
3. Add error messaging to UI for failed API calls

### Before Next Test
- ✅ Verify assignment resolution works via HTTP requests
- ✅ Test all 4 computed fields successfully open modals
- ✅ Confirm formula, dependencies, and trends display correctly

---

## Additional Notes

- Database seed data is correct (verified 12 computed fields, 20 assignments, 48 historical records)
- All Phase 1 & 2 features continue working normally
- UI components are ready and waiting for backend fix
- No code changes needed in frontend (UI is correct)

---

**Conclusion:** Phase 3 cannot proceed until backend assignment resolution bug is fixed. Feature is completely blocked.

**Next Action:** Backend developer to investigate tenant scoping in `resolve_assignment()` function.
