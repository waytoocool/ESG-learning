## Known Limitations (Expected for Phase 1)

The following are **intentional** and will be addressed in Phase 2:

1. **Historical Data Tab**: Shows loading message only (API integration pending)
2. **Field Info Tab**: Shows loading message only (API integration pending)
3. **Form Submission**: Buttons present but not functional (Phase 2)
4. **File Upload**: Accepts files visually but doesn't upload (Phase 2)
5. **Data Validation**: Not implemented yet (Phase 2)
6. **Entity Switching**: Not visible for single-entity users (expected behavior)

These are documented in the backend developer report and are planned for Phase 2.

   - Implement error handling for failed API calls

2. **Form Functionality**
   - Implement Save Draft functionality
   - Implement Submit Data functionality
   - Add client-side validation
   - Add unsaved changes warning

3. **File Upload**
   - Implement actual file upload to backend
   - Show upload progress
   - Display uploaded files list
   - Allow file deletion

4. **User Experience**
   - Add loading spinners for API calls
   - Implement success/error notifications
   - Add field-level help text
   - Consider adding keyboard shortcuts

5. **Testing**
   - Test with admin users (multiple entities)
   - Test entity switching functionality
   - Test computed fields (when available)
   - Test with various field types and dimensions
