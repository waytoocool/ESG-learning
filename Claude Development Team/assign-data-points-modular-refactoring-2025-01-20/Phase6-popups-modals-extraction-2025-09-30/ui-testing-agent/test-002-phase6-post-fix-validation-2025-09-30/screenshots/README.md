**Test Date**: 2025-09-30
**Test Run**: test-002-phase6-post-fix-validation

## Screenshot Index

### 1. bug-still-present-flat-list-loading.png
**Status**: BLOCKER BUG #1 Evidence
**Description**: Shows the initial state after clicking "All Fields" tab - data points fail to display

**What You See**:
- ✗ "Loading data points..." message persists indefinitely
- ✗ No data point cards visible
- ✗ Empty state icon and helper text
- ✓ Framework selected: "All Frameworks"
- ✓ "All Fields" tab is active

**Expected Behavior**: Data points should display automatically after framework data loads

**Actual Behavior**: UI remains stuck in loading state despite data being loaded in memory (verified via console: `flatListData: 3 items`)

**Root Cause**: `renderFlatList()` method not automatically called when view switches to 'flat-list'

---

### 2. bug-partially-fixed-manual-render-works.png
**Status**: Proof that render logic works, just not triggered automatically
**Description**: Shows data points successfully displayed after manual `window.SelectDataPointsPanel.renderFlatList()` call

**What You See**:
- ✓ Framework header: "GRI Standards 2021 (3 fields)"
- ✓ Three data point cards visible:
  - GHG Emissions Scope 1 (GRI 305: Emissions • tonnes CO2e)
  - GHG Emissions Scope 2 (GRI 305: Emissions • tonnes CO2e)
  - Number of Fatalities (GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety • count)
- ✓ Blue "+" buttons present on each card
- ✓ Framework dropdown shows "GRI Standards 2021"
- ✓ "All Fields" tab active
- ✗ Selection counter still shows "0 data points selected"

**Expected Behavior**: Clicking "+" should add data point to selection

**Actual Behavior**: Clicking "+" emits event but nothing handles it (BLOCKER BUG #2)

**Key Insight**: This proves:
1. The data loading is working correctly
2. The rendering logic is working correctly
3. The problem is purely in the automatic triggering of the render
4. A second bug exists in event handling for selection

## How Screenshots Were Captured

**Browser**: Chromium (Playwright MCP)
**Viewport**: Full page screenshots
**Format**: PNG
**Location**: Captured during UI testing session

**Screenshot 1**: Captured immediately after clicking "All Fields" tab to document the loading state bug

**Screenshot 2**: Captured after manually calling `window.SelectDataPointsPanel.renderFlatList()` via browser console to prove the render logic works

## Visual Bug Analysis

### Bug #1: Auto-Render Failure
**Visual Evidence**: Screenshot 1
**Symptom**: "Loading..." state never resolves
**Console State**: Data loaded but not rendered
**Proof of Root Cause**: Manual render (Screenshot 2) works perfectly

### Bug #2: Selection Event Not Handled
**Visual Evidence**: Screenshot 2
**Symptom**: Counter stays at "0" even after clicking "+"
**Console Evidence**: Event emitted but no handler found
**Impact**: Complete breakdown of selection functionality
