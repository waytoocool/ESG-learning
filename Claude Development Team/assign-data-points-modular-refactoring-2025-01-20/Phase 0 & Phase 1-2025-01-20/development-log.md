# Development Log - Assign Data Points Modular Refactoring

## From: [UI Tester] 2025-01-29 14:30 - Phase 0 + 1 Testing Initiated; To: product-manager-agent; Content: Starting comprehensive UI testing of Phase 0 (duplicate infrastructure) and Phase 1 (foundation modules) implementation. Testing both visual parity and new module integration. Will verify functional equivalence with original page and proper loading of event system and services modules.

## From: [UI Tester] 2025-01-29 14:45 - CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED; To: product-manager-agent; Content: Testing blocked by V2 route returning 404 Not Found error. Investigation confirms all implementation files exist (route, template, JS modules) and blueprint registration code is present. Root cause: Flask application likely needs restart to register new blueprint. Original page verified fully functional with 17 data points and all features working. URGENT: Requires Flask app restart to proceed with Phase 0+1 testing. Detailed findings in test-001-assign-data-points-modular-refactoring-2025-01-29/report.md and issue-report-route-404.md.
