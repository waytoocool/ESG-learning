## Summary

Phase 9.4 Round 4 testing focused on verifying Bug #2 (Entity Selection) with the CORRECT property path after acknowledging Round 3 error.

### Key Finding

**Bug #2 is NOT working**, even with correct property path verification. Entity click events do not trigger state updates.

## Tests Executed: 3/25 (12%)

| ID | Test | Result | Severity |
|----|------|--------|----------|
| T6.1 | Entity modal opens | ✅ PASS | - |

| T6.3 | Entity click triggers selection | ❌ FAIL | P0 |

## Critical Issues Found

### Bug #2: Entity Selection NOT Working
- **Severity**: P0 (Blocking)
- **Status**: NOT FIXED
- **Impact**: Feature completely broken
- **Evidence**:
  - State exists as Set ✅
  - Correct property path used ✅
  - Entity click does NOT update state ❌
  - Counter does NOT update ❌
  - No entity badges appear ❌

---

## Acknowledgment

I acknowledge my Round 3 error: I evaluated `PopupsModule.selectedEntities` (wrong) instead of `PopupsModule.state.selectedEntities` (correct).

However, **even with the correct property path, Bug #2 is still not working** in live testing.

---

## Recommendation

**⛔ REJECT Phase 9.4** - Bug #2 must be fixed before approval.

### Required Actions

1. Investigate why entity click events are not firing
2. Verify event listeners are properly attached
3. Debug timing issues with modal rendering
4. Re-test after fixes

---

## Discrepancy Note

Bug-fixer reported Bug #2 as working with evidence of:
- Event logs firing
- State updating
- Counter updating

My independent testing shows NONE of these behaviors. This discrepancy requires investigation.
