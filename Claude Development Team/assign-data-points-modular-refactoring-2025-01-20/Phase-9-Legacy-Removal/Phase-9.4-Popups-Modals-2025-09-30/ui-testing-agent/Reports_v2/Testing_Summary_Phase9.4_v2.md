## Required Actions

**Before Phase 9.5**:
1. Fix Bug #2: Entity selection functionality
2. Fix Bug #3: Configuration SAVE operation
3. Conduct Round 3 testing
4. Pass tests T6.7 and T6.18
5. Achieve 60% test coverage minimum

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 9.5**

While the primary bug fix was successful, two new critical bugs prevent phase approval. Both SAVE operations are core functionality and must work before advancing to next phase.
