# Phase 9.4 Popups & Modals - Round 2 Testing Report

## Test Session Information
- **Test Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Test Type**: Bug Fix Verification & Re-test
- **Tester**: UI Testing Agent
- **Application URL**: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2
- **Test Credentials**: alice@alpha.com / admin123
- **Framework Tested**: High Coverage Framework
- **Data Point Tested**: High Coverage Framework Field 1

## Executive Summary

### Round 2 Testing Objective
This round of testing was conducted to verify the fix for critical Bug #1 from Round 1, where the Entity Assignment Modal failed to open. The primary goal was to validate the bug fix and complete critical SAVE operation tests (T6.7 and T6.18) that could not be executed in Round 1.

### Key Findings

**PRIMARY SUCCESS**: Bug #1 FIXED ✓
- The Entity Assignment Modal now opens successfully
- Root cause was identified and resolved in ServicesModule.js
- Entity tree renders correctly with all entities visible

**CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED**: 2 New Bugs
1. **Entity Selection Not Working**: Entities cannot be selected in the Entity Assignment Modal
2. **Configuration SAVE Not Working**: Apply Configuration button does not trigger API call

**Tests Executed**: 8/25 tests (32%)
**Tests Passed**: 6/8 (75% of executed tests)
**Tests Failed/Blocked**: 2/8 (25% of executed tests)

### Final Recommendation

**STATUS: FIX BUGS FIRST - DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 9.5**

While the primary P0 bug (Entity Assignment Modal not opening) has been successfully fixed, two NEW critical issues prevent Phase 9.4 approval:

1. Entity selection functionality is broken, blocking Entity Assignment SAVE test (T6.7)
2. Configuration SAVE functionality is broken, failing critical test T6.18

Both SAVE operations are P0 critical functionality and must be fixed before Phase 9.4 can be approved.

## Detailed Test Results

### Test Category 1: Entity Assignment Modal (T6.1 - T6.10)

#### T6.1: Entity Assignment Modal Opens ✅ PASSED
**Bug Fix Verification**: This was the primary P0 bug from Round 1

**Test Steps**:
1. Loaded assign-data-points-v2 page
2. Selected "High Coverage Framework" from framework dropdown
3. Clicked "Assign" button for "High Coverage Framework Field 1"
4. Observed Entity Assignment Modal opening

**Result**: PASSED ✓
- Modal opened successfully
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Modal rendered with all expected UI elements

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `screenshots/t6-1-before-clicking-assign-button.png`
- Screenshot: `screenshots/t6-1-entity-modal-opened-successfully.png`

**Bug Fix Validation**:
- Root cause: Function name mismatch in ServicesModule (getEntities() vs getAvailableEntities())
- Fix implemented: Added getAvailableEntities() method with caching in ServicesModule.js
- Fix verified: Modal now opens without errors

---

#### T6.2: Entity Tree Renders Correctly ✅ PASSED

**Test Steps**:
1. With Entity Assignment Modal open
2. Observed entity tree structure
3. Verified entity count and names

**Result**: PASSED ✓
- Entity tree rendered successfully
- 2 entities visible: "Alpha Factory" and "Alpha HQ"
- Tree structure displayed correctly
- Entity icons and expand/collapse functionality present

**Evidence**: Screenshot shows entity tree with both entities visible

---

#### T6.4: Multi-Entity Selection ⚠️ BLOCKED

**Test Steps**:
1. With Entity Assignment Modal open
2. Clicked on "Alpha Factory" entity
3. Clicked on "Alpha HQ" entity

**Evidence**: Console logs show event firing but no state update

---

#### T6.7: Entity Assignment SAVE Operation ⚠️ BLOCKED

**Test Steps**:
- Could not execute due to entity selection bug

**Result**: BLOCKED
- Cannot select entities to test SAVE operation
- Dependent on T6.4 entity selection fix

#### T6.18: Configuration SAVE Persists Data ❌ FAILED

**Test Steps**:
1. With Configuration Modal open
2. Changed frequency from "Annual" to "Quarterly"
3. Clicked "Apply Configuration" button
4. Waited 3 seconds
5. Checked network requests for API POST call
6. Observed modal behavior

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Tests Executed: 8/25 (32%)

**Passed**: 6 tests
- T6.1: Entity modal opens ✅
- T6.2: Entity tree renders ✅
- T6.8: Cancel closes modal ✅
- T6.11: Config modal opens ✅
- T6.12-16: Config form fields render ✅

**Failed**: 1 test
- T6.18: Configuration SAVE ❌

**Blocked**: 1 test
- T6.4: Multi-entity selection ⚠️
- T6.7: Entity assignment SAVE ⚠️

### Tests Not Executed: 17/25 (68%)

**Reason for Low Coverage**:
1. Primary focus was bug fix verification and critical SAVE tests
2. New bugs discovered blocked further testing
3. Cannot proceed with additional tests until SAVE operations work

**Tests Pending**:
- T6.3: Entity search functionality
- T6.5: Entity unselection
- T6.6: Entity expand/collapse
- T6.9: Save button state
- T6.10: Entity save confirmation
- T6.17: Field validation errors
- T6.19: Config cancel behavior
- T6.20: Config modal close
- T6.21-25: Additional modal tests

## Phase 9.4 Approval Assessment

### Success Criteria Review

**Minimum Pass Rate**: 15/25 tests (60%)
- **Current**: 6/25 passed (24%)
- **Status**: DOES NOT MEET CRITERIA ❌

**Critical Tests Status**:
- T6.7 Entity Assignment SAVE: BLOCKED ❌
- T6.18 Configuration SAVE: FAILED ❌
- **Status**: CRITICAL TESTS NOT PASSING ❌

**Bug Fix Verification**:
- Bug #1 (Entity Modal Not Opening): FIXED ✅
- **Status**: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED ✓

### Final Verdict

**PHASE 9.4 STATUS: NOT APPROVED - FIX BUGS FIRST**

**Reasoning**:
1. While the primary P0 bug fix was successful, two NEW P0 bugs were discovered
2. Both SAVE operations (entity assignment and configuration) are broken
3. SAVE functionality is core critical functionality - cannot proceed without it
4. Test coverage (24%) falls below minimum threshold (60%)
5. Critical tests T6.7 and T6.18 cannot pass in current state

**Required Actions Before Phase 9.5**:
1. Fix Bug #2: Entity selection functionality in Entity Assignment Modal
2. Fix Bug #3: Configuration SAVE operation (Apply Configuration button)
3. Conduct Round 3 testing to verify both fixes
4. Complete critical tests T6.7 and T6.18 successfully
5. Achieve minimum 60% test pass rate (15/25 tests)

## Recommendations for Development Team

### Immediate Priority: Fix 2 Critical Bugs

**Bug #2: Entity Selection**
- Debug: `entity-toggle-requested` event handler
- Check: State management for entity selection

- Test: Selected Entities counter updates correctly

**Bug #3: Configuration SAVE**
- Debug: Apply Configuration button click handler
- Check: API endpoint configuration
- Verify: Network request is properly constructed and sent
- Test: Modal closes and shows success notification after save

### Testing Strategy for Round 3

**Focus Areas**:
1. Verify Bug #2 fix - entity selection works
2. Verify Bug #3 fix - configuration save works
3. Complete T6.7 - Entity assignment SAVE with persistence check
4. Complete T6.18 - Configuration SAVE with persistence check
5. Execute remaining high-priority tests to reach 60% coverage

**Success Criteria**:
- Both SAVE operations work end-to-end
- Data persists and reloads correctly
- Minimum 15/25 tests passing
- No P0 bugs remaining
