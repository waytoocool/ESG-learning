## Deferred Tests (18 tests)

**Justification**: All deferred tests are lower priority (Medium/Low). They cover cosmetic features, edge cases, and advanced functionality that do not block Phase 9.3.

**Examples**:
- Search results highlighting (cosmetic)
- Keyboard navigation (advanced accessibility)
- Tooltips (UX enhancement)
- Nested sub-topic rendering (edge case)
- Loading states (performance polish)

**Risk**: LOW - All core functionality is tested and working

---

## Performance Observations
