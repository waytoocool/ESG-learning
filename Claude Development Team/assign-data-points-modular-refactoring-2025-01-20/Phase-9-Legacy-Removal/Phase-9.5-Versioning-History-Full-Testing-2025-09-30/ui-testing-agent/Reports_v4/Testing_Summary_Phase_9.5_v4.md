## Critical Blocker Details

**BUG: Missing Versioning Tab (P0)**
- **Expected:** 3 tabs (Field Details, Assignment History, Versioning)
- **Actual:** 2 tabs (Field Details, Assignment History)
- **Impact:** Cannot access version management features
- **Status:** Reported in v3, claimed fixed, but **UNCHANGED in v4**

**Evidence:**
- DOM inspection confirms only 2 tabs exist
- Screenshot shows modal with 2 tabs clearly visible
- Version management UI completely inaccessible

---

## What Changed from v3

✅ **FIXED:**
- Version numbers display (was "undefined", now shows "Version 8", etc.)
- Dates display (was "Invalid Date", now shows "28/09/2025, 17:45:46")

❌ **NOT FIXED:**
- Versioning tab still missing (CRITICAL P0 BLOCKER)

---

## Final Recommendation

**REJECT Phase 9.5**

Cannot approve because:
1. P0 bug remains unfixed (Versioning tab missing)
2. 60% of tests cannot be executed due to missing UI component
3. Core version management features inaccessible to users
4. Requirements not met (3-tab modal specification)

**Required Action:**
Developer must add the Versioning tab to the Field Information modal before Phase 9.5 can be re-tested or approved.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 4-6 hours
**Re-Test Time:** 2-3 hours
