## BUG_R5_001 Fix Verification

### Test Setup
1. **Framework Selected**: Complete Framework
2. **Topic Tested**: Emissions Tracking (6 fields)
3. **Initial State**: 19 data points already selected (from existing assignments)

### NEW Modular Page Results ✅

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to NEW page: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign-data-points-v2
2. Select "Complete Framework" from dropdown
3. Wait for topics to load with field counts
4. Verify "Add All" button appears on "Emissions Tracking" topic
5. Click "Add All" button

**Results:**
- ✅ "Add All" button **VISIBLE** on topic header
- ✅ Button shows proper icon and text: " Add All"
- ✅ Button appears on hover over topic header
- ✅ Topic shows field count: "(6)"
- ✅ Clicking button added **ALL 6 fields** from the topic
- ✅ Counter updated correctly: 19 → 25 data points (+6)
- ✅ All field names display correctly (not "Unnamed Field")
- ✅ No duplicates created
- ✅ New "Other" topic group appeared with 6 fields

**Console Logs (SUCCESS):**
```
[SelectDataPointsPanel] Add all fields from topic: 58d6c105-01c4-4015-9146-c642d6f09762
[SelectDataPointsPanel] Adding 6 fields from topic "Emissions Tracking"
[SelectDataPointsPanel] Added 6 new fields (0 already selected)
[AppEvents] topic-bulk-add: {topicId: ..., topicName: Emissions Tracking, fieldsAdded: 6}
```

**Screenshots:**
- `new_page_01_initial_load.png` - Initial page state
- `new_page_02_add_all_button_visible.png` - "Add All" button visible on hover
- `new_page_03_add_all_button_clicked_result.png` - All 6 fields added successfully

### OLD Legacy Page Results ❌ **BUG DISCOVERED**

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to OLD page: http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/admin/assign_data_points_redesigned
2. Select "Complete Framework" from dropdown
3. Wait for topics to load
4. Click "Add All" button on "Emissions Tracking" topic

**Results:**
- ✅ "Add All" button **VISIBLE** on topic header
- ❌ **CRITICAL BUG**: Only added **1 field** instead of 6
- ❌ Counter updated incorrectly: 17 → 18 data points (+1 only)
- ❌ Success message misleading: "Added 1 data points from topic"
- ❌ Only "Complete Framework Field 2" was added
- ❌ Missing 5 other fields from the topic

**Console Logs (FAILURE):**
```
Selecting all data points in topic: 58d6c105-01c4-4015-9146-c642d6f09762
Topic header clicked: Emissions Tracking Event target: JSHandle@node
Clicked on topic actions, ignoring
updateSelectedCount: container found, total cards: 18, visible cards: 18
```

**Screenshots:**
- `old_page_01_initial_load.png` - Initial page state with 11 topics visible
- `old_page_02_complete_framework_selected.png` - After framework selection
- `old_page_03_add_all_button_bug_only_1_field.png` - **BUG: Only 1 field added**
