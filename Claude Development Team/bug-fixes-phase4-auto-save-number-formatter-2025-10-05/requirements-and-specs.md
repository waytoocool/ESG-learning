# Bug Fix: Phase 4 Auto-Save and Number Formatter Issues

## Bug Overview
- **Bug ID/Issue**: Phase 4 v3 Critical Bugs
- **Date Reported**: October 5, 2025
- **Severity**: Critical (Auto-Save) / High (Number Formatter)
- **Affected Components**:
  - Auto-Save Handler (Phase 4 Advanced Features)
  - Number Formatter (Phase 4 Advanced Features)
  - User V2 Dashboard Modal System
- **Affected Tenants**: All companies
- **Reporter**: UI Testing Agent (Phase 4 v3 Testing)

## Bug Description

### Bug #1: Number Formatter Not Applying to Dynamic Inputs
The number formatter feature initializes successfully but does not attach event handlers to dynamically created dimensional input fields. When users enter numbers like "1234567", they are not formatted with thousand separators ("1,234,567") as expected.

**Impact**: Poor UX, reduced readability of large numbers, non-professional appearance

### Bug #2: Auto-Save Not Initializing When Modal Opens
The auto-save feature completely fails to initialize when the data entry modal opens. No console messages appear, no auto-save timer starts, and draft functionality is completely broken. Users cannot save drafts or benefit from automatic data persistence.

**Impact**: Complete loss of draft functionality, high risk of data loss, blocks 45% of Phase 4 test suites

## Expected Behavior

### Bug #1: Number Formatter
- Numbers should format with thousand separators on blur event
- Input "1234567" should display as "1,234,567" after user tabs out
- Formatting should apply to all number inputs (including dynamically created dimensional inputs)
- Users should see raw numbers while editing, formatted numbers when not focused

### Bug #2: Auto-Save
- Console message "Auto-save started for field: {field-id}" should appear when modal opens
- Auto-save timer should start (30 seconds)
- Form changes should trigger auto-save status updates
- Draft data should persist to database and localStorage
- Status indicator should show "Unsaved changes" when form is dirty

## Actual Behavior

### Bug #1: Number Formatter
- Number formatter initializes at page load
- But event handlers not attached to dimensional matrix inputs (created dynamically after modal opens)
- Numbers display without formatting in dimensional input fields
- Page load inputs work fine, but modal inputs don't format

### Bug #2: Auto-Save
- Modal opens successfully
- NO auto-save initialization message in console
- Auto-save handler never instantiated
- No auto-save timer running
- No draft save functionality
- Complete feature failure

## Reproduction Steps

### Bug #1: Number Formatter
1. Navigate to http://test-company-alpha.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8000/user/v2/dashboard
2. Login as bob@alpha.com / user123
3. Click "Enter Data" button on any field with dimensional data (e.g., "High Coverage Framework Field 1")
4. Modal opens with dimensional breakdown (Gender dimension)
5. Enter a large number (e.g., "1234567") in Male gender input
6. Tab out or click elsewhere to trigger blur
7. Observe: Number remains "1234567" instead of formatting to "1,234,567"

### Bug #2: Auto-Save
1. Navigate to User Dashboard V2
2. Login as bob@alpha.com / user123
3. Open browser console
4. Click "Enter Data" button on any field
5. Modal opens successfully
6. Check console for auto-save messages
7. Observe: NO message "[Phase 4] Auto-save started for field: ..."
8. Observe: NO auto-save status indicator
9. Observe: Making changes doesn't trigger auto-save

## Fix Requirements
- [x] Number formatter must attach to dynamically created inputs in modal
- [x] Number formatter must work on all dimensional matrix inputs
- [x] Must maintain backward compatibility with existing page load inputs
- [x] Must not break existing functionality
- [x] Auto-save must initialize when modal opens via programmatic modal.show()
- [x] Auto-save must listen to correct Bootstrap 5 modal events
- [x] Auto-save must start timer and show status indicators
- [x] Auto-save must trigger on form changes
- [x] Must maintain tenant isolation
- [x] Must be tested across all user roles

## Success Criteria

### Bug #1: Number Formatter
- Console shows "[Phase 4] Number formatters attached to dimensional inputs" when modal opens
- All number inputs (page load AND dynamic) have formatters attached
- Numbers format with thousand separators on blur
- Focus shows raw number, blur shows formatted number
- Works for all dimensional breakdowns

### Bug #2: Auto-Save
- Console shows "[Phase 4] Modal shown event fired" when modal opens
- Console shows "[Phase 4] Auto-save started for field: {field-id}" after modal shown
- Auto-save status indicator appears in modal header
- Status updates to "Unsaved changes" when form is modified
- 30-second timer operates correctly
- Draft save API calls execute
