Fiscal Year Service

This service provides utility functions for fiscal year operations after the migration
from assignment-level FY configuration to company-level FY configuration.

Key Features:
- Calculate current fiscal year for a company
- Generate fiscal year lists for dropdowns
- Convert between calendar and fiscal years
- Validate fiscal year dates
